# Iris Classification Model

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Iris Classification Model** project! This project utilizes logistic regression to classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The classification is based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. To make this model accessible and easy to use, we have deployed an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Species Classification:** A well-trained logistic regression model to accurately classify iris species.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive web application built with Streamlit for seamless user interaction.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Get instant classification results by inputting flower measurements.
- **Educational Purpose:** Ideal for those interested in learning about machine learning and logistic regression.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression for classification.
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit for building and deploying the web application.
- **Programming Language:** Python for both model development and web app implementation.
- **Libraries:**
  - Scikit-Learn for machine learning model.
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Streamlit for web application deployment.

## Usage
- Open your web browser and navigate to the local Streamlit application.
- Input the flower measurements into the provided fields:
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
Click on the "Classify Iris" button to get an instant prediction of the iris species.

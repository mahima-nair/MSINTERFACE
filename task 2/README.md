# Unemployment Analysis with Python

## Overview

**Unemployment Analysis with Python** is a comprehensive data analysis project that delves into the trends and patterns of unemployment in India especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. Using Pythonâ€™s powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, this project aims to uncover insights and provide a clear picture of the unemployment landscape across various demographics and regions in India.

## Project Description

This project is designed to analyze and visualize unemployment data to understand its causes, impacts, and trends. The analysis encompasses several key aspects:

- **Data Acquisition:** Gathered data through Kaggle's benchmarked dataset
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Applying statistical techniques to explore and summarize the main characteristics of the data.
- **Visualization:** Creating insightful visualizations to represent unemployment trends, regional disparities, and demographic breakdowns.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performing in-depth analysis to identify factors affecting unemployment and drawing actionable conclusions.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards:** Utilize interactive visualizations to explore unemployment trends dynamically.
- **Trend Analysis:** Analyze trends over time to understand how unemployment rates have evolved.
- **Regional Breakdown:** Compare unemployment rates across different states and regions in India.
- **Timeline Analysis:** Compare unemployment rates across different months of the year 2020.

## Technologies and Libraries

This project leverages several Python libraries and tools for data analysis and visualization, including:

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For advanced data visualization with statistical plots.
- **Plotly:** For interactive and web-based visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For any machine learning models, if applicable.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the analysis process and results in an interactive environment.

# Car Price Prediction Using ML Techniques

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction Using ML Techniques** project! This project leverages the power of machine learning to estimate the price of a car based on several key factors. By using linear regression, we have developed a robust model that takes into account variables such as car brand name, engine capacity (cc), transmission type, ownership history, fuel type, and horsepower (BHP). Additionally, we've created an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to easily input these factors and get an instant price prediction.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Price Estimation:** Utilize a well-trained linear regression model to predict car prices with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A sleek and intuitive web application built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Get immediate price estimates based on the input features.
- **Comprehensive Factors:** Consider various crucial factors such as car brand, engine size, transmission type, ownership history, fuel type, and horsepower to ensure a precise prediction.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit for building and deploying the web application.
- **Programming Language:** Python for both model development and web app implementation.
- **Libraries:** 
  - Scikit-Learn for machine learning model.
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
  - Streamlit for web application deployment.

## Usage
- Open your web browser and navigate to the local Streamlit application.
- Input the required car details into the provided fields:
  - Car Brand Name
  - Engine CC
  - Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)
  - Ownership (First/Second/Third)
  - Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric)
  - Horsepower (BHP)
- Click on the "Predict Price" button to get an instant car price estimation.
